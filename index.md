I am a Ph.D. student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Srinivasa Narasimhan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srinivas/). My research focuses on computer vision and imaging, exploring modalities beyond the visible spectrum to enable new imaging capabilities. I am currently focused on developing novel algorithms that leverage heat transport and light transport to infer shape, material properties, and scene semantics.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was a Research Scholar at NEC Laboratories America, where I worked in the [Media Analytics](http://www.nec-labs.com/research-departments/media-analytics/media-analytics-home) department with [Prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/) on problems related to trajectory prediction and Embodied AI.

Feel free to connect with me at **snochurn@cs.cmu.edu**.
