Later built the perception system where sensor outputs were converted to obtain occupancy. Further, integrated the planner and perception systems together. The internship ended with demonstrating autonomous navigation with GPS waypoints as input.<br />

	A multi-robot task execution problem, where two robots simultaneously plan paths, coordinate and execute a task of playing an audio file in a concurrent fashion. We apply Fast Fourier Transform to decode the notes present in the audio file and provide them as inputs to the robots. The robots are aware of the map but are unaware of the obstacles present on the map. They map is updated and replanning is done when any one of them encounters an obstacle.<br />

<!-- #### <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Q1tsOjkWNgl8JsLJuONBHBynsyhAjAG/view"> Background Subtraction based on Two-Univariate Gaussian Model for Automatic Surveillance Applications </a>
<img src="/images/projects/collage_bs.png" width="171" height="57" align="right">
<font size="2">
​During my 3rd year of bachelors I joined Prof. Manigandan to work on the thread of Background Subtraction. During this I designed a novel background subtraction algorithm based on a set of univariate gaussians. I got an improved F-Measure of 0.8221 and a percentage of false classification stood lowest at 2.6%. I implemented various background subtraction algorithms such as ones based on Gaussian Mixture Model, Kernel Density Estimation and Adaptive Background Learning as baselines for comparisons.

<font size="2">
In my Bachelor thesis, I worked on developing various modules of the Mahindra e2o electric vehicle. Along with others, I started  off with developing a stable low level controller from scratch by tapping in wires from various parts of the vehicle and moved on to develop the perception and planning module. In this process, I demonstrated static obstacle avoidance in tight spaces which was showcased in the Research and Development showcase held at IIIT Hyderabad. Also, a part of my thesis culminated into a paper which got accepted at AIR 19.

<font size="2">
During my summer 2017, I joined IIIT Delhi to work on a self-driving car project. Where I was responsible for designing the controller and planner for the vehicle. The first phase was designing a high level controller to achieve the inputs from the planner. The second phase was development of perception and integrating planner with it. Developed occupancy maps that is given as input to an OMPL based planner. Finally, demonstrated autonomous navigation given the waypoints as input.

<img src="/images/projects/husky.png" width="171" height="57" align="right">
<font size="2">
Built a autonomously navigating bot using visual perception. The bot was made capable of obstacle avoidance and waypoint following in outdoor and indoor scenarios. Various sensor informations were fused using robot localization. Sensors like stereo camera, GPS, IMU and wheel encoders were used. Occupancy map was generated upon which planning was done for the bot to follow autonomously.

<font size="2">
In my 6th semester during my undergrad, I worked on a interesting problem of multi robot task execution. Where two robots simultaneously plan path and execute a task of playing an audio file in a concurrent fashion. The first task was doing a Fast Fourier Transform and decoding the notes present in the audio. These notes are fed to one of the robot which makes a plan and gives it to the second. The two robots have common map which gets updated when any one of the robot encounters an obstacle.

<img src="/images/projects/autonimbus.png" width="171" height="57" align="right">
<font size="2">
With a boom in Internet of things based devices over the past decade, I gathered up with like minded people during my sophomore to create a platform which connects the vehicle to the cloud. We designed a complete car monitoring platform using the car's On Board Diagnostics(OBD). With the help of data collected we were able to predict impending brake downs and also to help in gear shifting to the user. An app based on Android was designed which connects via bluetooth to the OBD scanner. The information is sent to the cloud where classical machine learning algorithms are deployed to monitor the car's behaviour. This project was selected for the National Finals of General Electric India Innovation Challenge held at Bangalore.

<img src="/images/projects/cop.png" width="171" height="57" align="right">
<font size="2">
During my sophomore, I designed a robot that localises with the help of camera on the top by estimating the pose of contours, of an arbitrary colour assigned to the robot using OpenCV python library. In this project I implemented a PID based control system based on the kinematics of differential drive robot. The goal was to collect loots placed at different colour locations in the arena. An efficient algorithm for collecting the loots was also designed. This project got the 1st place in Pragyan technical festival held at NIT Trichy.

#### <a href="http://nnsriram.blogspot.com/2015/12/sudoku-solver-real-time-image.html"> Sudoku Solver for a Real Time Image </a> 
<img src="/images/projects/sudoku.png" width="171" height="57" align="right">
<font size="2">
In my junior year, I built a Sudoku solver which provides a solution to the Sudoku when an image of a Sudoku is shown as input to the camera. It first does an affine transformation to get the appropriate region of interest in the image. The input image is then processed and every grid in the image is identified. By this method, the region of each cell in the image can be calculated. It is then given as input to identify the digits using OCR based on OpenCV. Once each digit present in the Sudoku is identified then a simple Brute Force Mechanism is used to solve the Sudoku.

<img src="/images/projects/appkivy.png" width="171" height="57" align="right">
<font size="2">
In my first year, I built a cross platform mobile app that can run on OSX, Linux and Windows. It is a game controller that uses inbuilt accelerometer present in the device. It features controls for nitro and brake, and the control for steering is achieved by tilting the device. It gives precise control of the vehicle as opposed to pressing keys on the keyboard. Also, it makes the game more interesting with the experience of controlling using your mobile.
